Tread lightly, my dear child,\
don't ever let these, sunken thoughts run so wild,\
I have failed a thousand times,\
And I have cried a million times,\
And often I have wondered, why I even tried ?\
It's not a serious crime,\
We all have failed from time to time,\
You are forever loved,residing in my heart... remember that in your hard times...
